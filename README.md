# SmolPilot

A demo of a 360M parameter model in your pocket. Showcasing what the future could look like with small language models in the browser.

- Powered by [SmolLM-360M](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-360M)
- Uses [WebLLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm) to run the model in the browser on WebGPU.

Yes, the model will hallucinate and repeat itself, but think about the possibilities and have a little fun!
